# directory-inventory-database
This access database keeps track of a faculty/staff directory and company devices checked out to them.
Schema and data were derived from spreadsheets, physical records, and output of a powershell script.
Includes queries for data representation and entry forms for new records.
Will become the basis for a more permanent solution (hosted in Sharepoint) in the future.
